    "6x6": "Place a digit from 1 to 6 into each empty cell in the grid so that each digit appears exactly once in each row, column and 2x3 outlined box. No cell that is a knight-step away can contain the same digit. A knight's move is 2 in a line and 1 to the side, as in chess.",
    "9x9": "Place a digit from 1 to 9 into each empty cell in the grid so that each digit appears exactly once in each row, column and 3x3 outlined box. No cell that is a knight-step away can contain the same digit. A knight's move is 2 in a line and 1 to the side, as in chess."
