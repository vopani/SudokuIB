## Mission üöÄ
To build a collaborative encyclopedia of information on sudoku and its variations, commonly termed as an Instructions Booklet (IB).

There are thousands of sudoku variations that have been created and many more being invented each year by sudoku authors around the globe. These are repeatedly used in sudoku championships at a regional, national and international level.

## Content üìÇ
This repository hosts the following information on sudoku variations:

* **Title:** Name of the sudoku in a clean and case-sensitive format.
* **Rules:** Instructions that typically explain the rules of the sudoku for different grid sizes.
* **Tags:** Commonly used attributes for grouping, categorizing and describing the type of sudoku.
